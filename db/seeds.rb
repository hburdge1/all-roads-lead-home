The basement is illuminated only by the thin streams of light bleeding in through that very window, albeit quelled by the grayness of the world outside. Dust motes fly into the air as you push yourself up off the couch, stretching and wiping the remnants of raindrops from your forehead. As you stare off into the cavernous space beyond the light, you are struck by the silence. Could you possibly have slept through the entire holiday party? Something isn’t right. You see, far across the room, a unique and wholly separate halo of light, coming from the stairway that leads to the main floor. However, that staircase is a far stretch across the black void, and you feel nervous proceeding forward with no glimmer of light to guide you.  What do you do?',

You stretch out your hands in front of you to avoid running into anything face-first, and meander across the vast space, stretching your foot out carefully before taking each step. You wander for what feels like forever, never feeling a single object near feet nor face. Frustrated, you begin to stride quickly, then to jog, then to sprint, and still nothing. Exhausted, you turn back towards whence you came, only to see that you are mere steps from the hazy light. That’s impossible, you tell yourself. The dark is playing tricks on me.',

Wind swirls across the thick blanket of snow, tossing a few flakes into the air and onto the immaculately-plowed driveway, where they quietly melt away. The cars along the winding driveway are coated with a light dusting of white, and the beauty of the scene being lit cinematically by the lights from the veranda is breathtaking.

I’m burning up in here.\” His wide, crooked grin surrounded by his smattering of freckles manages to pull out your smallest smile, and you slip on the weighty coat. \“I’ll be in in a second, okay? Save a drink for me, will you?\” \“I’ll do what I can— but it’s pretty lively in there… No promises.\” Eyes glinting, he steals back inside, leaving the door open just a crack.

The din of the crowd washes over you as you wind your way through the party, light orchestral music twisting through the buzz of conversation and the sparks of laughter around the room. After what feels like forever, you reach the hors d’ouvres table— only to find both wine bottles fully empty. \“Toby just left to get some more, don’t get yourself too worked up,\” your Aunt Marnie tells you, laying a warm hand on your shoulder. \“It’s really been too long, Julia.

Glancing over towards the door towards the kitchen, you tell her, \“I can’t wait for Toby— I’ll go see if he needs a hand\”. Squeezing her shoulder, you tell her “I’m really happy to see you,\” and this, you mean.

You can’t even count the number of hours you spent with your eyes glued to that painting while trying to survive another family event with another group of family friends… or even with just your family. You are amazed even now by the movement you can almost feel blowing from the mouth of the West Wind, Zephyrus, that ripples the fabrics and hair in its way so elegantly. Your mother, an artist in her own right, had tried for years to convince you to love classical art, and while in most part she had failed, you do feel a glow in your heart for this particular painting. Breathing deeply, you make your way to the bar that separates the dining room and the kitchen. You lean against the wall, arms crossed, watching your mother put neat little fruit tarts onto a tray, sticking her tongue out in concentration as she works. Your father is in the other corner of the kitchen, pulling a bottle of chardonnay out of the wine fridge.

I know our last fight was bad, but this is over-overkill. \“Hey, ma.\” You nod to your father over her shoulder, and he raises his eyebrows in acknowledgement before turning back to his task of opening the wine bottle. \“Julie, my love, you look amazing! I can definitely tell that you’ve been taking good care of yourself out there\”. She releases you from her grip, looking you up and down, her eyes stopping pointedly at your newly-size-3 thighs. You desperately fight the urge to roll your eyes. \“Mom,\” Toby interjects definitively.

You cut her off as you take the tray and spin on your heels. \“You’ve had plenty of chances to give me useful advice over the last 25 years,\” You mutter under your breath as you stalk into the hallway. Your feet obscured by the tray, you’re of course unable to see Granger’s paw underfoot as you step into the foyer proper.

Why do I turn into a five-year-old again every time I come home? I’m so much better than this.

From outside the kitchen door, you hear a faint beeping that grows louder and louder until it is ear-splitting. You run to the kitchen door and push against it– only to find it stuck shut. \“Guys?\” you call into the hallway. \“Hey!\” When still no answer comes, you take a few steps back and ram your shoulder into the door, feeling it give a little. You step back further and full-out run to batter the door with your shoulder again, and though you repeat this several more times, your shoulder aching more and more with each hit, the door never gives any more or less than it initially did. You shriek with frustration, and you notice now that smoke is seeping in from under the door. Frantically, you look around you, and your eyes are drawn to a paperweight sitting atop a side-table underneath that Botticelli– and the window next to it. With a deep breath, you grab it and slam it against the window as hard as you can. The glass doesn’t break, but it does crack, and you thank God your parents never had these old windows replaced. You reel back, hurl the weight, and the glass shatters apart. You pull a chair under the window, perch atop it, and jump through the jagged opening, feeling a deep pain in your side, but otherwise safe. 

As quickly as you can, you scramble to your feet and rush to the front door, desperate to open it for your family– only to realize you locked it from the inside. No other windows on the front of the house are large enough for a person to squeeze through, and as you panic, you begin to hear the sounds of screams from inside the house, helpless, you do the only thing you can think to do.",
